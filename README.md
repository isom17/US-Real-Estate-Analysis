# US-Real-Estate-Analysis
This case study focuses on real estate properties in the United States that were for sale in 2021. Our case study attempts to uncover what variable(s) have a significant impact on the price of a property such as bedroom count, bathroom count or the size of the home itself. 
## Dataset
-The dataset we employed was sourced on Kaggle and collected from https://www.realtor.com which is a real estate listing website operated by News Corp subsidiary called Move, Inc. based in Santa Clara, California.

## Exploratory Analysis
Performed exploratory analysis by creating a pair plot of the variables in the dataset to determine positive or negative trends. We can see observe positive correlations between "Price" and key variables of ‘bed’, ‘bath’ and ‘house_size’ based on these scatter plots but needed to calculate the significance statistically to better understand the strength of the correlations. Our correlation matrix proves only moderate relationships between the price of properties and other key variables which suggests there are many data points that fall outside of our hypothesis and need to explore other methods to explain our data. 

## Cluster Analysis
Our cluster analysis created 4 groups for each of the key variables' comparisons against price. The analysis further confirms the diversity of property in our dataset. 

The data suggests the properties in this dataset vary significantly across different geographical locations, particularly between urban and rural areas.

## Recommendations
**US Property in the Northeast**
-The data analysis confirms there are only  moderately strong correlations between the key variables and market price suggesting varying property types and features across different geographical locations, particularly between urban and rural areas.

-In this scenario, the best use of the data is for a real estate agent to offer this a dashboard to their potential clients looking for properties in specific Northeast states, with a specific budget and other features. 

## Limitations of the Case Study
-We only had data focused on the Northeast of the United States. 
-The data only had a limited number of variables. Data on how long a property had been on the market and the year a property was built would have provided deeper insights. 

**Next Steps:**
-Gather more information that includes samples from all of the states. 
-Received updated information on housing prices.
